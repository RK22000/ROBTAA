Few things about the project setup about tailwind. Following this [guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit) gets me set up with tailwind. However there's this funny little thing in tailwind where it basically strips out a lot of the default stying information. For instance by default it will make all the headers the same. Now tailwind does make it super easy to individually customize every element with fair precission. So tailwind wan't you to do the customization yourself and it recommends not relying on defaults so that you are not blindsided by any nitpicky thing in the defaults. However defaults are usefull so tailwind gives you a plugin to get a good set of helpfull defaults that can easily be applied. That's [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin). Apply the `prose` class on any vanila html element and the usefull default typography will carry over to all the children.

You know those things that you never notice because they just work. Then you suddenly notic it because it no longer work. Ya it sucks to find out when they no longer work. 

I reinstalled wsl on my machine to uninstall a program that for some reason I was unable to uninstal. Don't know what blood magic I used to bind that installation to my wsl instance that it was easier to uninstall, then reinstall wsl and everything else. But anywasy I did that and I forgot to save my ssh config files from the previous installation. So I had to reset up ssh with github. That was a pain. I'm not gonn reliv it by typing it out. But just thought you should know.

Oh the template project uploads and deploys freely on pushing to main.

I've got a feel for how things to make a site using svelte and tailwind. I have a barely active blog site that I think could be made to look better. 2+2=Refactor the blog site into a svelte tailwind site that I understand and might use more often.
