    "abstract":"I like to animate stuff in matplotlib. But as cool as it is to make animations, its also a pain to share the animation scripts for anyone else to use. This is where Binder came in to save the day. It allows me to share my scripts in a neat package that anyone can run and tweak with no any setup on their end.",
    "abstract2":"Ever since I've become familiar with animation in matplotlib, I keep trying to animate every concept I wish to understand. You know cuz when you first hold a hammer everything looks like a nail. This proved really helpful in learning but sharing my animation scripts to allow my friends to make their own animations was a pain. This is where Binder came in and saved my day. Binder allows me to share my animation scripts (code, dependencies, and all) in a neat package that my friends can run and tweak hassle free without any setup on their end.",
    "abstract1": "Ever since I've become familiar with animation in matplotlib, I've kept noticing the possibility to animate lots of ideas, and I end up animating a few of those. However I always felt dejected when I couldn't easily share those animations with others. Sure I could export and share an mp4. But the real magic of matplotlib animation was tweaking animations in python. Questions that arose on seeing the animations can immediately be answered by tweaking the code to see new results. That treatability is what I wanted to share. Now I think I've found a way to do just that using Binder",
