![Animation Prepared Using Matplotlib](animation_in_matplotlib/simple_RRT.gif)

I made this animation in matplotlib (inspired by [these](http://lavalle.pl/rrt/gallery.html)). Over the past few months I've managed to explore (to varying degrees) a few different tools to create animations through code.

[Skip to the meat and potatoes of how to animate stuff in matplotlib](#the-meat-and-potatoes-of-funcanimation)

### [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)

This was I think the very first animation library that I used.

I heard about it from a friend and jumped at the chance to try it out when a school project called for creating a visualization. Recently while reading the 3 Body Problem books I was inspired to create these 2 simulations.

- [In this one I added damping and corrective forces to ensure that the 3 bodies continue to perform a dynamic dance](../3BodySimulation/3body1.html)
- [In this one I avoided adding any damping and corrective forces to see what the Trisolaran system might actually look like](../3BodySimulation/3body2.html)

### [Manim Community](https://www.manim.community/)

I came across Manim because of [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). For a long time I've admired how well he breaks down and builds up any topic that he covers, but his video animation is just

So I tried to create some animations like him. Earlier this summer I created an animation to show a kind of error that can happen at the Data Link Layer of a network connection if the acknowledgement window size for packets is larger than half the acknowledgement packet ids being used.

Do note 3Blue1Brown uses a different fork of the Manim Library. I used the Community fork and it was pretty good.

### [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

I've been using matplotlib to visualize data as charts and graphs for a good while now. But it was only recently that I was prompted to try and animate the visualized data. My first approach was based on how I saw Manim created its animation. Manim looked like it created frames and partial animations then stitched them together using ffmpeg. So my first approach to animating matplotlib was to save a plot for every frame that I wanted to animate then stitch them together. This works and I'd recommend it if you have already written the code that can plot the frames your interested in plotting and animating. However, if your about to write that code, I'd recommend reading the rest of this blog so you can use [matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation.html#matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation)

## The Meat And Potatoes of FuncAnimation

> Its late I'm sleepy I'll write this later. I'm sorry if you needed this right now ðŸ˜´ðŸ™‡

It's later, so I'm writing it now.

There are 2 fair ways I've seen to animate stuff in matplotlib.

- FuncAnimation: Use a function to modify plot on every frame
- ArtistAnimation: I didn't get around to properly understanding this one

But according to [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/animations/animations.html) `FuncAnimation` is more efficient than the later. `ArtistAnimation` is supposed to be more flexible but `FuncAnimation` is flexible enough for the things I've tried. So thats what I use.

I'll demo `FuncAnimation` by showing how it can be used to produce this animation

### Quick tangent to cover the data

This data is the [Worldwide Population Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivd24coder/worldwide-population-data) and I got it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Its a tabular data set about historical population trends and I think even predictions based on those trends.

This dataset has population records not only by countries but also by geographic regions, development levels, and more.

For this demo I selected the total population of only those records which were of countries.

### Back to animation

The code to create this animation is quite small. Also I'm assuming that you have at least some experience with python.

```py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.animation as anime
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def main():
    df = pd.read_csv('data/WPP2022_Demographic_Indicators_Medium.csv')
    df2 = df.loc[df.LocTypeName=='Country/Area', ['TPopulation1Jan', 'Location', 'Time']]
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    def topPopulations(year, present_year, n):
        ax.clear()
        ax.set_title(("Prediction: " if present_year < year else "") + str(year))
        sns.barplot(ax=ax, data=df2.loc[df2.Time==year, ['TPopulation1Jan','Location']].sort_values(by='TPopulation1Jan', ascending=False).iloc[:n], x='TPopulation1Jan', y='Location')
        fig.tight_layout()

    ani = anime.FuncAnimation(
        fig=fig,
        func=topPopulations,
        frames=df2.Time.unique(),
        fargs=(2023, 10)
    )
    plt.show()

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
```

There are 2 significant sections in this code. The first is the `topPopulations()` functions, and the second is the `anime.FuncAnimation(...)` constructor call.

These 2 sections demonstrate the style in which `FuncAnimation` animates a plot. You start out with an initial figure, and you make a function that can modify the existing figure into the required figure for a frame. Over here that function is `topPopulations()`.

Given the year that is to be animated, the present year, and the number of countries to display in the graph, `topPopulations()` will create a bar graph of the top `n` most populous countries. If the population is a prediction of the future then it will set the title to reflect that.

```py
# Look it over again
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
def topPopulations(year, present_year, n):
    ax.clear()
    ax.set_title(("Prediction: " if present_year < year else "") + str(year))
    sns.barplot(ax=ax, data=df2.loc[df2.Time==year, ['TPopulation1Jan','Location']].sort_values(by='TPopulation1Jan', ascending=False).iloc[:n], x='TPopulation1Jan', y='Location')
    fig.tight_layout()
```

`FuncAnimation(...)` then uses the `topPopulations()` function to animate the figure. `FuncAnimation(...)` takes 3 main arguments; The figure to animate, The function that will animate, and frames. The first 2 act as you might expect but frames actually has some flexibility to behave in a few different ways.

`frames` could be the number of frames to animate, or it could be an iterable of identifiers for each frame. In this demo it's an iterable of years. It's a list of all the years that need to be animated. The `frames` will also be the first argument passed on to the function that will modify the figure. It can be used by the function the determine which frame needs to be drawn and therefore which modification should be made. If the modification function needs some more arguments they can be given to `FuncAnimation(...)` in the `fargs` parameter. `FuncAnimation(...)` will pass these same arguments to the modification function for every frame.

Now call `plt.show()` and matplotlib will work its magic. Ooohh once you have the `ani` object you can also call `ani.save('population.mp4')` instead of `plt.show()` to save the animation instead of displaying it. Just make sure to have ffmpeg on your environment if you want to save the file as mp4. If not you'll have to save it as a gif. And that's it. That covers everything about using `FuncAnimation(...)`.

![A pair of eyes with text "blit=True" looking up at the previous paragraph](animation_in_matplotlib/blit_looking_up.png)

Oh ya, there's the good old `blit` that I almost forgot about. `blit` is a parameter in `FuncAnimation(...)`. Using and not using `blit` can make a difference like this

| Without blit | With blit |
|--------------|-----------|
|![Animation of a ball bouncing slowly](animation_in_matplotlib/bounce_no_blit.gif)|![Animation of a ball bouncing fast](animation_in_matplotlib/bounce_blit.gif)|

I'll get around to writing about it later cuz its late and I'm sleepy

You can clone my [repo](https://github.com/RK22000/Matplotlib-Animation-Demo) to run the demo as a script or inspect it as a notebook. The repo also has a demo of using blit with `FuncAnimation(...)`. Doing so speeds up the animation by a lot.
