I tested this on the FashionMNIST dataset and tracked the boosting effect of different SVC kernels on models trained to a different number of Epochs. This boosting technique appears to be an easy drop in solution to boost to a trained CNN.","picture_relative_source":"blogs/enhancing_cnns_using_svc/SVC_powered_by_CNN.png","date":"2020-12-20","relative_path":"blogs/boost_your_score_within_SECs.html","dir":"boost_your_score_within_SECs"},{"title":"Diffuson Gan Models","picture_relative_source":"Haggaling_Aangs/aang_distorted_0.5.png","abstract":"There's this group ML enthusiasts I meet with every week to discuss and talk about cool ML stuff. I barely understood anything the first few times we met but recently we discussed a paper on cold diffusion models that seemed to clear up a lot about image generation for me.","date":"2022-11-18","relative_path":"blogs/diffusion_gam_models.html","dir":"diffusion_gam_models"},{"title":"Enhancing Cnns Using Svcs","picture_relative_source":"/blogs/enhancing_cnns_using_svc/SVC_powered_by_CNN.png","abstract":"Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a cool technique to classify stuff but I haven't seen it be used for image classification. In this post I'm writing about my experiment to classify images using an SVC by preprocessing the images using a CNN.","date":"2022-12-01","relative_path":"blogs/enhancing_cnns_using_svc.html","dir":"enhancing_cnns_using_svc"}]}
